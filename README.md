If you are new to creating data visualizations with Python, it is not unlikely that you've run into the struggles of delving deep into the catacombs of the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/contents.html">Matplotlib</a> and <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> documentation pages to try and change the smallest details of your plots away from the defaults. While both Matplotlib and Seaborn do a excellent jobs of providing built-in styles to work with, I know I always felt myself wanting to make my graphs a little bit more unique with some personal _flare_. I warn you now: there is no substitute for reading through the documentation and getting a basic understanding the nature of the vast collection of objects and plotting functions available in these libraries. But, if you are a tactile learner like myself, you'll probably learn ten times as much by getting your hands dirty and practicing the skills yourself. Continue reading if you would like to learn how to

* Create custom styles by setting parameters with an .mplstyle file 
* Exercise greater control over the fonts and colors used in your plots
* Decide when to use Seaborn vs. Matplotlib
