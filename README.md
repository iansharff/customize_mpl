If you are new to creating data visualizations with Python, it is not unlikely that you've run into the struggles of delving deep into the catacombs of the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/contents.html">Matplotlib</a> and <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> documentation pages to try and change the smallest details of your plots away from the defaults. While both `matplotlib` and `seaborn` do a excellent jobs of providing built-in styles to work with, sometimes you'll want to make your graphs more unique, and using .mplstyle sheets is one way to accomplish this while also maintaining consistency in your visualizations. Here, you'll learn to...

* Create custom styles by setting parameters with an .mplstyle file 
* Exercise greater control over the fonts and colors used in your plots
* Decide when to use Seaborn vs. Matplotlib
